# Pacchetti (di Lamponi)

A Raspberry Pi Package Manager

OK! ...
These are my thoughts:

So I was bored ... And I just wrote a GUI.
Then I thought that Synaptic was too complicated for beginners ...
Then I thought Add / Remove Software hardly has any programs
Then I thought Gnome software was pretty cool ...

# Note: This software is absolutely not ready
