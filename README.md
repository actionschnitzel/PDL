# Pacchetti (di Lamponi)

A Raspberry Pi Package Manager    
    
OK! ...    
These are my thoughts:    
    
So I was bored ... And I just wrote a GUI.    
Then I thought that Synaptic was too complicated for beginners ...    
Then I thought Add / Remove Software hardly has any programs    
Then I thought Gnome software was pretty cool ...    
    
# Note: This software is far from ready    
    
Useage:
```
sudo apt-get install xterm -y    
sudo apt-get install python3-pil python3-pil.imagetk -y    
sudo apt install python3-pip -y    
```

```
$ python3 home/pi/PDL/Essentials.py
```
